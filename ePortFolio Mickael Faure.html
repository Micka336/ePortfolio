            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Mickael Faure, passionate about the world of music, and more specifically about hard music DJs. This ePortfolio, which represents the waveform of a track, gives access to five tabs by clicking on five colored cues (interesting moments of a piece that serve as reference points for the DJ) : </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my studies at the t² preparatory school, we were asked to complete a six-week internship. While researching, one laboratory was more original than the rest due to its focus: Cherchons pour voir, located in the IRIT at Paul Sabatier University, which centers its projects around the visually impaired.
            </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among their main projects, I worked with JAVA on the Tangible Box , a printed shelf representing a specific space, such as the premises of the IJA (Institut des Jeunes Aveugles). When the user moves the piece to a special square (a room, a staircase, etc.), a sound associated with that square is played. This allows visually impaired people to use this device to learn how to find their way around certain places in an interactive way.
            </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My role in this project was to develop a simulator for researchers. This has improved their working conditions in several ways.
            </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the practical side, researchers can now simply open the simulator and make changes to it, rather than having to find an available Tangible Box. This has optimized teamwork.
            </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, from an environmental and economic perspective, this avoids creating new copies that would only be used for research, and therefore saving on the necessary materials. Obviously, users remain on the physical device and not on this simulator, which is only dedicated to researchers.

                    <h3>Scootering</h3>
                    <img src="Resources/scootering_square.jpg" alt="backflip with my scooter">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been riding a freestyle scooter for over 7 years now. It's a discipline that has forced me to overcome my fears, but it has also allowed me to travel and discover a whole community of enthusiasts.</p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, I discovered hyperpop music production (rap with digital sounds) and breakbeats (tracks whose drum patterns are taken from breaks in well-known songs and then rearranged). But today, I would like to become a hard techno DJ, starting by mixing at ENSEEIHT parties.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also go to the gym four times a week, twice with my parents. In addition to the athletic aspect, I have developed a real desire to keep my body healthy through good nutrition and a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To check my weeks of travel, several destinations naturally come to mind given my passions, especially freestyle scootering. There are places in the world where it is much more popular than in France, particularly England and the Netherlands. Over there, skateparks such as Adrenaline Alley (Corby) and Area51 (Eindhoven) are much more developed and designed to be perfect.
On the other hand, Japanese culture has always intrigued me, ever since I was a child, and I promised myself I would go there one day. Perhaps this is the perfect opportunity ?

            <h2>Civic engagement</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement my civic engagement, I think it would be interesting to join women7. This association aims to promote women in engineering to middle school girls during a dedicated day.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been immersed in scientific and digital studies for two years, and having greatly enjoyed this start, I think I can motivate these young girls to join the digital world for their studies. Today, women are still very much in the minority in engineering compared to men, and it is time to change that.</p>
